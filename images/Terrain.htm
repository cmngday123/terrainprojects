      <p2 class="text">Terrain Projects re-align the human spirit with nature through contemporary multimedia events. This platform is used to address wider ecological solutions continuously undermined by human-nature separation. Terrain Projects reinforce the powerful transformative effect interdisciplinary arts can have on humans within civic life.
        <br><br>
      Our human-nature relationship is seen as the deep cause underlying this Earth’s ecological crisis. To fall back in love with the Earth would raise the question of why you would ever do anything to hurt something you love. This also directs us towards questioning what made us fall out of love with the Earth in the first place. Each Terrain Project aims to fuse emerging post-humanist and more-than-human modes of interaction with the environment from diverse disciplines and to present these ideas in a social space by curating events. Each Terrain Project explores an aspect from our ecological web to reconcile our relationship with it, piece by piece.
        <br><br>
      We aim to address the broader question of the kind of geological sedimentary layer humans would like to leave behind. To understand what lies within our geo-social formations so that we can contribute to re-shaping them with love.
        <br><br>
      Sir David Attenborough’s recent address for ‘Our Planet’ reiterates that people won’t care, legislate or prioritise the environment if they don’t love and appreciate it first. Through multidisciplinary arts and interdisciplinary collaboration aimed for experience based learning, affecting individuals in this way is the motivation for Terrain Projects.
