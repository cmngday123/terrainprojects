      <p class="text">This platform is used to address wider ecological solutions continuously undermined by human and more-than-human [nature] separation. Humans won’t care, legislate or prioritise the environment if they don’t love and appreciate it first.
        <br><br>Terrain Projects reinforce the powerful transformative effect interdisciplinary arts can have on humans within civic life <sup>[1]</sup> by incubating social spaces to engage with post-humanist substances.
To fall back in love with the Earth would raise the question of why you would ever do anything to hurt something you love. This also directs us towards questioning what made us fall out of love with the Earth in the first place. <br><br>Each Terrain Project explores an aspect from our ecological web to reconcile our relationship with it, piece by piece; with the aim to address the broader question of the kind of geological sedimentary layer humans would like to leave behind. To understand what lies within our geo-social formations so that we can reinstate a sustainable human positionality within it.
<br><br>—<br><br>
<small><sup>[1]</sup> Civic life: The public life of the citizen concerned with the affairs of the community and nation as contrasted with private or personal life, which is devoted to the pursuit of private and personal interests.</small>
